# Assisted Living Out of Bounds (ALOB)



## What is ALOB?

ALOB is a solution inspired by the [AAL programme](http://www.aal-europe.eu/about/) to provide medical solutions to your relatives and loved ones while they stay at home completely comfortable. At the same time, it can be used by specialists to make diagnosis from their offices and receive them inmediately via chat. 



## What makes it so amazing?:

*No need for exhausting and expensive stays in a hospital. ALOB allows you to stay at home to get the results.

*Your doctor will be able to get the same data and share opinion with you about it from home.

*Easy to use and easy to install. You will only need an internet connection and a computer.
